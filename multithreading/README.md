### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a thread
* What are the differences between a thread and a process
* What is the difference between Concurrency and Parallelism
* How to create a thread
* How to properly exit a thread
* How to handle mutual execution
* What is a deadlock
* What is a race condition

### Requirements

[B] Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 9.4.0 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to have more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called multithreading.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header files
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are allowed to use global variables
* You are allowed to use static functions and variables

## Betty Compliance
- All the C source files in your directory and subdirectories must be Betty-compliant
- Allowed Functions and System Calls
- Unless specified otherwise, you are allowed to use the C standard library
- Data structures
- Here are the data structures used throughout this project, make sure to include them in your header file multithreading.h.
